# Mist & Moon

Built with a love for mystery, storytelling, and the strange beauty of old paper.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a magical newspaper-style site I discovered on GitHub.  
All design and code are my own, but the concept was sparked by that creator’s unique vision.  
Grateful for the spark — this is my own take on that inspiration.

This project was inspired by The-Daily-Crimes by [@rinkitadhana](https://github.com/rinkitadhana).  
I really liked it and wanted to build something myself in a similar spirit — with my own stories.

## Final Note

> Not all news is new — some of it is ancient and waiting.
